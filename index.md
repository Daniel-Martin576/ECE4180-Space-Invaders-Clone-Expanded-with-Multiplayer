#Space Invaders Clone


#Overview
Our project is a clone of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders, but with some additional features over other mbed clones. The basic features we have are a joystick that moves the player's ship, a button to fire bullets from the ship, and a LCD screen to display the game. However, our clone boasts some additional feature over other mbed clones. 
Namely we have added some sound effects played via a speaker with an amp and a second player that can connect to the game over a bluetooth module using the Bluefruit Connect app on a Bluetooth enabled phone.
